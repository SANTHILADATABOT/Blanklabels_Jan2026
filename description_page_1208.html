<h2>Christmas greetings from BlankLabels.com.au.</h2> 
<p class="text">The  team at <span class="boldtext">BlankLabels.com.au </span>would like to take this opportunity to thank you, our customers, for making this our best year yet! Since many of you, our clients, are in some sort of business, and by way of thanks, we would like to offer this free booklet : <a href="www.survivaltrap.com">The Survival Trap by Paul McCarthy</a>.  This free book is packed with practical ways to help businesses survive the new economy as well as continue to thrive!  </p>
 <p class="text"> <span class="boldtext">BlankLabels.com.au </span>will continue to take online orders right through the Christmas break. </p>
 <p class="text">Blank label orders paid for and received before Monday 22nd December 2008 should be delivered before Christmas. Orders after this date will be shipped on January 5th 2009 in the order they are received. </p>
 <p class="text">Printed labels or other printed work paid for and received this week 'may' be shipped before Christmas. Otherwise, limited production will be occurring from January 5th - 12th and full production again thereafter. </p>
 <p class="text">We are currently in negotiation with our suppliers who are telling us that the cost of our supplies will increase in the new year. At this stage
   we are unsure as to the increase in costs. You may like to take this opportunity to lock in our current rates by placing your order now. We will advise you immediately once we issue our new price list early in the New Year.   </p>
 <p class="text">On behalf of <span class="boldtext">BlankLabels.com.au </span>we wish you all a Blessed Christmas and a wonderful New Year!   </p>
