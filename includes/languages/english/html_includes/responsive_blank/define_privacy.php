<h4>Do you use cookies on your website?<a name="tc8"></a></h4>
<p>Our website is designed to make it easy for you to find out about our products, to apply for them and to manage your account where applicable. To do this, some of our websites may use cookies, which are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's memory or hard disk for record keeping purposes. Cookies can help us make your experience of the website more relevant, and they can also help us learn about how people use our website (and therefore help make it better). Most web browsers are set to accept cookies, but you can always change your computer settings to stop them. If you choose to do that, you may not be able to take full advantage of our online services.</p>
<h4>Can I get access to my information or change or delete it?<a name="tc9"></a></h4>
<p>At any time, you can find out what information we hold about you by emailing us at sales@BlankLabels.com.au. If there's any reason why we can't disclose any of the information we have, we'll let you know why (for example, we may choose not to disclose the reasons for declining applications for credit, so that fraudsters aren't able to figure out how to get around the system). If you want to change any information we have about you, you can do that as well. If you want us to delete information we'll certainly do our best, but may need to keep information for legal or service reasons. If this is the case, we'll let you know.</p>

<p>What happens if your Privacy Policy changes in future? We listen to the feedback our customers give us, and also what the broader public has to say about what we do. This informs how we develop new products and services, and also new ways of working. Because of this, our Privacy Policy may need to change from time to time. If it does, we'll publish the new version on this website but won't necessarily send you specific notice of any change. Any changes we make will abide by the Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988. And of course, we'll continue to treat your personal information with the highest respect.</p>
<h4>Is my personal information secure?<a name="tc11"></a></h4>
<p>We make every effort to keep any information we hold about you secure. We store your information on secure servers that are protected from unauthorised access. We also train our staff to respect your privacy and keep your information confidential, and we ask the same standards of companies who work for us.</p>
<h4>Are my online transactions secure?<a name="tc12"></a></h4>
<p>We ensure your protection with a Secure Socket Layer (SSL), which scrambles your data to make it unreadable by third parties. It does this by:</p>
<p><strong>Server authentication:</strong> The web server sends a digital certificate to your computer so that you can be sure of its identity (and know that the transaction is protected - you'll see a lock symbol up the top of the browser next to the URL).</p>
<p><strong>Client authentication:</strong> Your computer authenticates itself to the server by showing its digital signature. Encryption During the internet connection, data that's transferred from your computer to the server is scrambled, so that only your computer and the server can understand the contents of the transaction. This prevents other internet users from intercepting the information sent.</p>
<p class="quote">Blank Labels.com.au also does printed labels, stickers, business cards, invoice books, magazine, newsletters and more.<br><strong>Why not <a href="index.php?main_page=contact_us">ask us for a quote?</a></strong></p>
